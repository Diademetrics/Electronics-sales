### Electronics sales report

This dataset is gotten from Kaggle and is synthetic data. It highlights the sales of tech devices for a company across Q4 of 2023 and Q1-Q2 of 2024
--
#### Key highlights from the dataset

-	Sales greatly increased from 2023-2024, indicating a rapid growth in the company’s popularity.

-	The top two most sold products were smartphones and smartwatches across the two years accounting for 50% of total sales. Headphones, however, haven’t done so well because headphones were recently added to the products list and therefore customers are not aware that the company has started selling headphones. It is recommended that to push headphone sales, promotions, activations and price slashes are employed.

-	August and January are the months when sales were highest. November and December were the months with the lowest sales.

-	Of the 15 thousand customers only three thousand were loyalty members, indicating that membership isn’t popular among users. To increase the number of members, incentives like providing a 5% discount on all purchases of over a hundred dollars for loyalty members or providing a gift card for loyalty members could help increase membership.

These are just a few insights that can be derived from this dataset.
